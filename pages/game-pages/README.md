# Games I replaced when adding the games from Zenithub
I'm warning you, this list is an interesting one.
- Super Mario Construct --> Taisei Project, I had my eyes closed when picking the replacement tbh
- Roblox --> Nuts and Bolts Screwing Puzzle. It sounded like a game someone requested, and Roblox isn't really possible anymore.
- Subway Surfers (Normal) --> A bunch of versions like Winter holiday, Miami, etc.
- Tap Goal --> Deltarune + Unfair Undyne + Ultrakill. Dunno why Tap goal exists to begin with, and I needed an excuse to add these.
- Edge Surf --> Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genisis. dunno why i did this.
- Riddle School 2 --> Red Ball 4. I saw it and needed to add it, im sorry.
- Fifa 2007 --> Fifa 11. Couldn't find 07 sorry
- Gacha Life --> Doom. Genuinely do not know why Gacha Life was on my site to begin with. Also Doom being the go-to game for unusual device hacks is hilarious.
- Death Run 4D --> Among Us. Lets be real, the _"90% of the games have to be embedded"_ thing that I made myself do was an excuse to add games other sites have but I don't.
- The spot Pokemon Stadium was --> Omori. I found out that gn-math just lets you download the games as pages.
- Super Hot --> Karlson. Like I said. Ima be fr. The _"90% of the games have to be embedded"_ thing is an excuse to have games other sites have but I don't.
- Time Shooter --> Hollow Knight. The first TS wasn't even there.
- The spot Basket Random was --> Basketball Stars.
